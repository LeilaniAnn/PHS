<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
<figure>
<blockquote>K-Plus does what it is supposed to for my dog (increase his pH). He thinks they are treats so no problem getting him to eat them. He used to be on prescription Potassium Citrate tablets, and when the price of them more than doubled, I switched. I have seen no difference in effectiveness so I would consider trying them and saving yourself $$$$.</blockquote>

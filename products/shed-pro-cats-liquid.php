<blockquote>Cat adopted from a shelter...male is black and white, and female is marble color
I have 2 larger cats, and with my busy schedule, I have to admit they are not brushed often. I have to say that giving this product with each meal twice a day has saved me. They both hardly ever throw up Hair balls. And they are both over 14 lbs. and both have medium length coats. Their coats are shiny and healthy, and they are both just over 10 years old. I am a believer!</blockquote>

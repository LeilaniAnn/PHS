  <h1>Felisyl<sup>&reg;  </sup>| Immune System Support Soft Chews</h1>
  
  <p>Felisyl Immune System Support for Cats is a safe nutritional supplement for your cat if it has a condition that is responsive to L-lysine. L-lysine has been known to reduce the harshness and number of occurrences of herpes simplex viral infections. These infections result in fever blisters and cold sores. L-lysine is an effective ingredient of Felisyl Immune System Support for Cats.</p>
  
  <p>In cats, the herpes virus is considered very contagious. What makes it so problematic is that it is a very common cause of upper respiratory infections (URIs). Symptoms of URIs include eye discharge and sinus congestion in your cat. You may also notice some squinting of the eyes and sneezing as part of the effects of an upper respiratory infection. Felisyl Immune System Support for Cats can help.</p>

<p>Other benefits to Felisyl Immune System Support for Cats are that it helps promote healthy tissue, encourages respiratory health, and can even help with your catâ€™s vision. It is effective, easy to administer, and has some nice additional healthy side effects.</p>

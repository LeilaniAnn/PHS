<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
<figure>
<blockquote>Lady is a rescue dog and she becomes very anxious when she hears fireworks, gunshots, thunder, etc. We used to give her Benadryl when thunderstorms were passing through our area and it worked OK but tended to make her very drowsy. I saw the TranQuil-Tabs when I was searching the internet for natural calming supplements or medications and decided to order some after reading reviews on this product. We have had several severe storms this spring and our dog goes from pacing the floor to being able to calm down and relax after she takes the TranQuil-Tabs. This product has made a significant difference in the quality of our dog's life during periods of loud noises and I would highly recommend the TranQuil-Tabs to other dog owners.</blockquote>

<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
<figure>
<blockquote>Have been using Shed-Pro for the last 3 wks and have noticed a big change in my labradoo's coat!
Put it in her dry food and she even licks the extra off the spoon before eating her food. Her coat has waxed thicker and softer. Is certainly not as dry as before and the big benefit is that she has stopped scratching herself from dry skin( we are in the middle of a typical dry mid-West winter here in OH.). Good stuff and will buy more later.</blockquote>

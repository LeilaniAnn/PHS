<h2>Testimonials:</h2>

<blockquote>I saw this in the sale section and thought it would be a good supplement for my 11 year old Australian Shepherd. She is shinier than ever and has good energy - plus she likes this stuff! Very easy to put on top of her dry food - I twist the "handle" on the capsule and squirt it out onto her food.</blockquote>

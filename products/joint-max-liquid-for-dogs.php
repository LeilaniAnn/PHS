<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
<figure>
<blockquote>Our vet recommended [another product] but when I saw an ad for Joint MAX I asked which they thought was better for an older dog with hip problems. Well I switched to Joint MAX and my 11year old Airedale, a squirrel-chasing terrier is now a terror. It has truly made a difference in how he goes up and down stairs.....I see him running more and enjoying the next day more.</blockquote>

  <h1>Joint MAX<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup> &#124; Liquid for Dogs</h1>
  
  <p>Joint MAX<sup>&reg;</sup>Liquid for Dogs is an excellent option for pets suffering from conditions affecting the joints. Joint MAX can also be used long term on normal dogs to maintain strong bones as well as healthy cartilage and connective tissue, which helps joint mobility and function. Includes a palatable easy to use liquid delivery method, just pour the dose over the dog food. It utilizes a vegetarian beef flavor matrix made from soy.</p>
  
  <p>Joint MAX Liquid for Dogs incorporates a balanced formula of Glucosamine (Source: Shellfish - shrimp or crab), Chondroitin Sulfate (swine source) and Vitamin C into one highly palatable liquid. Glucosamine is an easily absorbed natural substance that may stimulate the production of proteoglycans, which help maintain the health and resiliency of joints and connective tissues. Glucosamine helps to maintain synovial fluid that lubricates the joints and helps maintain joint mobility. Joint MAX also contains Aloe Vera, MSM and Manganese for added joint support. </p>
  
  <p>Use Joint MAX Liquid to help your dog maintain healthy bone, connective tissue, and joint structure and function. Joint MAX Liquid provides antioxidants that reduce oxidative stress on tissue to support structural integrity of joints and connective tissues, which in turn helps support joint flexibility.</p>

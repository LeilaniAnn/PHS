<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
<figure>
<blockquote>Our 17 year old dog has always loved to run on our farm - but age has caught up with her. We decided to try to Joint MAX Double Strength Soft Chews to see if it wouldn't give her a little more flexibility and some pain free running. After three weeks of the Chews, she has been able to enjoy going out and doing "tractor work", as well as race around the house like she was a puppy again. Love those chews, as well as our dog.</blockquote>

  <h1>Joint MAX<sup><sup>&reg;</sup></sup> &#124; Double Strength Soft Chews</h1>
  
  <p>Joint MAX RS helps ease stiffness and promotes healthy cartilage and joints. Glucosamine and Chondroitin work together to promote improved joint health by strengthening your dog's cartilage. It also contains Vitamin C, Zinc and N-Acetyl-Cysteine for added joint healing. Recommended for dogs that show moderate signs of joint disease.</p>
  
  <p>You should use this if your pet is experiencing one of these symptoms:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Stiffness after exercise</li>
    <li>Difficulty jumping or climbing stairs</li>
    <li>Walking more slowly</li>
    <li>Hopping instead of running</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Joint MAX can be used alone or in combination with prescription drugs like Rimadyl<sup>&reg;</sup>, Etogesic<sup>&reg;</sup>, or Deramaxx<sup>&reg;</sup> and can eventually help decrease the need for these drugs.</p>

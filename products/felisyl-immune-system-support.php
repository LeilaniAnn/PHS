<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
<figure>
<blockquote>This product is EXACTLY what I have been needing for my two kitties! These granules have proven to be the very BEST product to deliver the 250 mg of L-lysine necessary for my cats health needs. I was using the L-Lysine in a pump, which is tuna flavored. The extra strong smell seemed to be a deterrent, even though they both love seafood flavored wet food. They would walk away and leave the food to spoil, causing me to have to open another can of food. When one of my cats recently had a herpes breakout (sniffles & runny eyes) I had to put the stinky tuna flavored thick L-lysine from the pump on my finger and stick it in her mouth to insure that she was being treated properly. The granules don't have a scent; both of my cats lap up their wet food; and my sweet kitty is now 100% well in less than 2 weeks! Like normal, I put the wet food in the bowl with water; mix it up; then put the tiny scoop of L-lysine granules on top; gently stir so that the granules are just barely mixed in - they lap it up and get 100% of this vital nutrient! I HIGHLY recommend this product! It is AWESOME!!</blockquote>

  <h1>Felisyl<sup>&reg;  </sup>| Immune System Support Granules</h1>
  
  <p>Felisyl Immune System Support for Cats is a safe nutritional supplement for your cat if it has a condition that is responsive to L-lysine. L-lysine has been known to reduce the harshness and number of occurrences of herpes simplex viral infections. These infections result in fever blisters and cold sores. L-lysine is an effective ingredient of Felisyl Immune System Support for Cats.</p>
  
  <p>In cats, the herpes virus is considered very contagious. What makes it so problematic is that it is a very common cause of upper respiratory infections (URIs). Symptoms of URIs include eye discharge and sinus congestion in your cat. You may also notice some squinting of the eyes and sneezing as part of the effects of an upper respiratory infection. Felisyl Immune System Support for Cats can help.</p>

<p>Other benefits to Felisyl Immune System Support for Cats are that it helps promote healthy tissue, encourages respiratory health, and can even help with your catâ€™s vision. It is effective, easy to administer, and has some nice additional healthy side effects.</p>

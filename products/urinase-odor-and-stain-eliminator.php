<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
<figure>
<blockquote>This product does what it says! I have tried EVERY product on the market, & none of them work like Urinase to get rid that odor. You spray it on the area you cleaned, let it dry, & the smell is gone! Newly neutered males I rescue will still urine mark once in awhile, & no product I cleaned with would erase the odor completely. I sprayed the area with Urinase after cleaning & I did not know it had been urine marked. Urinase works, indoors & out! Kudos to EP's for their super fast shipping, & great customer service!</blockquote>

<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
<figure>
<blockquote>I was about to go crazy with all the pet hair that was on my clothes, floor and sofa. I bought this product just to see what would happen. In less than 1 week the shedding was gone. I could not believe it. My clothes only have 2 or 3 hairs on them. My vac shows that thier is hardly any hair in it. I just love this stuff. I will keep gettin it as long as I have these dogs. It is the best stuff around.</blockquote>

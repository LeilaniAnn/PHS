<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
<figure>
<blockquote>Great product, safe, mild & gentle and helps fight gum disease and the bad breath that is caused by it. Our Dachshund came to us with really bad gum disease and missing teeth. After his teeth were cleaned, we began using this product every other day along with brushing and Plaque Off in his food. After just 6 months of use, I am happy to learn from our vet that our Dachshund is now growing new gum tissue and there's no sign of tartar! Can't beat the price either!</blockquote>

 </div><h2>For Use In:</h2> 
 Dogs and Cats<p>
 <h2>Administration:</h2>
Shake well before each use. Hold bottle upright, below your petâ€™s field of vision. Gently lift the upper lip to expose the teeth and gums. Point and squeeze to apply a gentle stream along the gum line. Ora-Clens dispenses rapidly and completely covers the entire oral cavity, even hard-to-reach areas. Avoid touching the gum with the applicator tip to avoid injury in case your pet moves.
</p>
  
<p><h2>Maintenance Administration:</h2> Rinse daily following each meal or as directed by your Veterinarian.</p>
  
  
  <p><h2>Cautions:</h2> Avoid contact with eyes. If eye contact occurs, rinse thoroughly. If undue skin irritation develops or increases, discontinue use and consult a veterinarian.</p>
  <p>Keep container at room temperature (59&deg;F-86&deg;F). Manufactured in the USA.</p>
  
  <p><h2>Warnings:</h2> For animal use only. Keep out of the reach of children and animals. In case of accidental overdose, contact a health professional immediately.</p>

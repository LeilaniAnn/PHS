<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
<figure>
<blockquote>Gracie, my 8 year old Mini Schnauzer, had an embolism 2 years ago in her hind quarters. The vet said we would most likely have to put her down due to poor quality of life. We never even considered this option. Instead, we took her home, educated ourselves and went to work. Through physical therapy, manipulation, diet and lots of love and encouragement she is thriving, even running and able to urinate on her own again. The embolism caused damage to her bladder so I bought this product at the recommendation of a friend and love it. Gracie has been on several expensive, chemical based products for bladder infections and they were not improving her condition. Since starting D-Mannose the ecoli has lessened, thus reducing inflammation in her bladder, thereby the necessity for antibiotics and chemicals is now almost obsolete. It's still early, but after 3 weeks she has shown vast improvement. I couldn't be happier with this product.</blockquote>

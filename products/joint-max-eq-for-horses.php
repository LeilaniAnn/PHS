<h2>Testimonials:</h2>
<figure>
<blockquote>I have an OTTB that was a winner at the track and retired at the age of 7. He never was quite 100% sound but had a huge heart. As he progressively got worse we knew we needed to make a change. This product has him 100% sound and has made it possible for him to continue into a second career as a hunter (yes he jumps! and loves it!).</blockquote>
